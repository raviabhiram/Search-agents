# Search-agents

A goal based search solution to any problem.  
This project provides implementation of two search algorithms:  
* Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)  
* A*  

To use these algorithms, simply import the ids.py and/or the a_star.py file(s).  

As a examples how these algorithms can be used, there are two problems that have been solved:  
* __Maze solver__ - Given an input of a maze where 1s represent hurdles and 0s represent a path, find a path from the top left to the bottom right of the maze.  
* __N-Queens__ - Given as input a number for the number of queens, solve the famous [n-queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle).  

The *draw.py* file draws the solution to the maze problem as well as the n-queens problem.
